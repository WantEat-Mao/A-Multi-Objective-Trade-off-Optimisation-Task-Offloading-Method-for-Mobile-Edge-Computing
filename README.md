In dynamic mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, heavy network loads often
lead to excessive processing latency and energy consumption, resulting in deadline violations
and task dropping. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed offloading
optimization algorithm (D3QN-LMA), based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We
formulate the multi-objective optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
and construct a novel reward quantification function that autonomously balances the trade-
off between strict latency constraints and energy efficiency. Unlike conventional methods, our
approach empowers devices to make long-term optimal decisions under time-varying constraints.
Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method: compared to
baseline algorithms, D3QN-LMA increases the task completion rate by approximately 40% and
reduces average processing delay by 11.2%. Consequently, the proposed approach significantly
enhances overall system reliability and responsiveness, with a marginal trade-off in energy
consumption.

To ensure the code is both usable and sufficiently robust, we are undertaking final code clean-up 
and drafting comprehensive usage documentation. We undertake to gradually upload the complete source code.
